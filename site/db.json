The true shape of the room, however, is that of a six-sided convex polyhedron. In addition to the peephole, there is a camera with live images shown inside and outside the room.",

The room is complemented by a video screen outside the entrance which allows other group members to watch their fellow visitors inside. A safety sign cautions visitors about the sloped floor, encourages visitors to keep their shoes on, that there should be no more than six people in the room at a time and that this exhibit is not intended for children under the age of 8 years old.

Hydrogen and oxygen gas is released from water through a process called electrolysis, powered by a hand crank generator. Hydrogen, being lighter than oxygen, gathers at the top of the tank where it surrounds an igniter. Upon ignition, the hydrogen gas burns instantly, recombining with oxygen to leave a by-product of water while propelling a model rocket upwards along a track.",

The electricity is generated by the vertical movement of floor tiles, which powers a small generator. The tiles are arranged in a 2x4 grid in front of a screen with a camera positioned above. The exhibit is intended to highlight that energy recovery systems will become more prevalent, i.e. in cars, shoes or even dance floors. New systems and materials allow this to happen.",
